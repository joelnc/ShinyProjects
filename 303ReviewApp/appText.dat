This Shiny App demonstrates the mechanics of a binomial test confidence interval, similar to what the State of North Carolina uses for 303(d) listing decsions.  There are two sets of tabs below, toggleable via the 'Hypothetical' and 'CharMeck Metals' links in the navigation bar above.  The Hypothetical and CharMeck data selection boxes below apply to the Hypothetical and CharMeck tabsets, respectively, and do not interact.

Eight selectable data sets are available above.  Each  data set description includes the total number of samples and the number of samples exceeding a hypothetical 10 mg/L Water Quality Standard. The "Slight" and "Vast" variations contain the same number of exceedances, however the exceedances in "Vast" are much greater in magnitude.  Toggling between these data sets will update the graphs below, as well as those in the subsequent tabs.

The plot on the left shows the time series concentrations of the selected dataset.  The statistical analysis in subsequent tabs will use these sample data, but first they must be converted to a series of 'Yes' / 'No' values, where 'Yes' means a given concentration exceeded the standard, while 'No' means it did not.  Converting the data in this way makes the "Slight" and "Vast"  data sets equivalent in the 90% Confidence Interval procedure, as long as the number of samples and number of exceedances does not change.  This can be seen in the Historgram on the right, by toggling between the first two data sets.

Next we look at the State's current 303(d) "Greater than 10% exceedance, with 90% confidence" approach.  In the plot below, the black diamond is the empirical exceedance percent for the selected data set (i.e., the number of exceedances, divdided by number of samples, multiplied by 100).  If a site is not currently 303(d) listed for this pollutant, then for purposes of this analysis the site is assumed to be in compliance.  Thus, the null hypothesis is 'Not Impaired', which is represented graphically by the gray shaded area.  For a site to be  303(d) listed based on these data, not only would the empirical exceedance point need to fall to the right of the 10% vertical line, so too must the entire 90% confidence interval (the black interval line).  What this means is that at small samples sizes (e.g., 13), a site can exceed more than 10% of the time, but will not be listed if the confidence interval doesn't "clear" 10%.

This plot shows the same analysis, but in the context of 303(d) delisting, or the conceptual reverse of the listing scenario.  This approach follows the analysis of the Lin et al. paper (See the 'Background' tab); however, the State did not adopt this analagous delisting procedure.  Rather, the same listing procedure analysis is to be repeated ever year, always with the base assumption or null hypothesis that the waterbody-pollutant combination is not currently exceeding standards.

Here, we will follow the statistical delisting procedure described by Lin et. al.  If a site is already 303(d) listed, one assumes that it is already exceeding standards more than 10% of the time (i.e., assume that the empirical point falls in the grey area).  To determine whether or not the site should be de-listed based on new data, one would check whether both the new exceedance percent and the full 90% percent confidence interval around that point are below 10%.  It can be seen that this determination (i.e., whether or not to delist) is sample size limited.  Even with 0 exceedances out of 13 samples (the 5th selectable data set above), the confidence interval still  exceeds 10%. With zero exceedances, a total sample size of 23 would be need to produce 90% "confidence" that the true exceedance percent is less than 10%.  Given 1 exceedance, an additional 36 non-exceeding samples would be needed to demonstrate compliance under this procedure.  With two exceedances, 50 non-exceedances would be needed.

The listing and delisting plots and analysis use one-sided binomial tests, given that there are rationales for a base assumption to test against (i.e., that the site is or is not impaired based on most recent 303(d) list).  A two-sided test can also be applied, and is shown below. Here, confidence interval speaks to "the true value is not likely outside of the range shown".

Note that for the same data set, the two-sided confidence interval will not match the Listing lower bound or the Delisting upper bound. This is due to the fact that for the 90% two-sided confidence interval we are allowing a 5% "chance" that the value is greater than the interval, and a 5% chance that it could be lower.  For the Listing (or Delisting) scenario, we simply checked whether we could be 90% "confident" that the site was above (or below) the 10% exceedance rate.

EPA's Decision Letter finds fault with the State's current appliciaton of 90% confidence to Listing vs Delisting decsions for conventional pollutants. However, EPA also states that even properly applied (e.g., applying the Lin. et al approach consistently for listing and delisting, as Alabama does) the 90% confidence procedure is not appropriate for toxic pollutants (e.g., metals, ammonia). An approach that EPA endores for Listing and Delisting of toxics is the following; if there is more than 1 exceedance in a three year period (regardless of number of samples or the magnitude of exceedance(s)), then a waterbody is classified as impaired. This is the so-call "One in Three" criteria, which the State may adopt in the future for toxics.
