Four selectable example data sets are available below. All data sets contain 13 hypothetical sample concentrations (or did, until I added the last 3 options), with differing numbers of samples in excess of a hypothetical 10 mg/L Water Quality Standard. The "Slight" and "Vast" variations contain the same number of exceedances, however the exceedances in "Vast" are much greater in magnitude.  In dataset 'Slight', 10 of the samples are below the standard, and the 3 exceedances are slightly above the standard.  In the dataset 'Vast', there are still only 3 exceedances, however they are much higher concentrations.

This plot shows the time series concentrations of the selected dataset. The analysis in the other tabs will use these sample data, but first they are converted to a series of 'Yes' / 'No' values, where 'Yes' means a given concentration exceeded the standard, while 'No' means it did not.  Converting the data in this way makes the "Slight" and "Vast"  data sets equivalent in the 90% Confidence Interval procedure, as long as the number of samples and number of exceedances does not change.  This can be seen in the Historgram tab by toggling between these two data sets.

This plot shows a simple histogram that converts the selected raw concentration data into 'Yes' and 'No' values, based whether or not each sample concentration exceeds the WQS.  The Slight and Vast (3 exceedance) datasets are identical in this context.

Next we look at the State's current 303(d) "Greater than 10% exceedance, with 90% confidence" approach.  In the plot below, the black diamond is simply the empirical exceedance percent (i.e., number of exceedances, divdided by number of samples, multiplied by 100).  If a site is not currently 303(d) listed for this pollutant, then the gray area represents the starting assumption (i.e., that exceedances occur less than 10% of the time and thus, the site is not impaired). To list a site, not only would the empirical point need to fall to the right of the 10% vertical line, so too must the entire 90% confidence interval (the black line interval line).  What this means is that at small samples sizes (13 in this case), a site can exceed more than 10% of the time, but if the confidence interval doesn't "clear" 10%, the site will not be listed.

This plot shows the same analysis, but in the context of 303(d) Delisting, or a conceptual reverse of the listing scenario.  This approach follows the analysis of the Lin et al. paper; however, the State did not adopt this delisting procedure.

In this case, assuming the site is already 303(d) listed, one assumes that it is already exceeding standards more than 10% of the time (i.e., assume that the empirical point falls in the grey area).  To determine whether or not the site should be de-listed based on new data, one would check whether both the new exceedance percent and the full 90% percent confidence interval around that point are below 10%. It can be seen that this determination (i.e., whether or not to delist) is sample size limited.  Even with 0 exceedances out of 13 samples, the confidence interval still still exceeds 10%. A sample size of 23, with 0 exceedances, would be need to be 90% confident that the true exceedance percent is less than 10%. Given 1 exceedance, an additional 37 non-exceeding samples would be needed to demonstrate compliance under this procedure.  With two exceedances, 52 non-exceedances would be needed.

The listing and delisting plots and analysis use one-sided binomial tests, given the rationales for a base assumption (i.e., that the site is or is not impaired based on most recent 303(d) list).  A two-sided test may also be used, and is shown below. Here, confidence interval speaks to "the true value is not likely outside of the range shown".

Note that for the same data set, the two-sided confidence interval will not match the Listing lower bound or the Delisting upper bound. This due to the fact that for the 90% two-sided confidence interval we are allowing a 5% "chance" that the value is greater, and a 5% chance that it could be lower.  For the Listing (or Delisting) scenario, we checked if we could be 90% confident that the site was above (or below) the 10% exceedance rate, and did not assess the maximum (or minimum) value we think the rate could be, but did not concurrnetly speak to the minimum (or maximum) value.
